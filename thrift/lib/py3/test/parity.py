"""
This file tests parity between thrift-py3 cython constants, which are
converted from thrift-cpp2 constants and python constants, where all values are
generated directly in python.

This file will also serve to test parity between pure python thrift-py3 structs
and existing cython structs, insofar as those structs are used in constants.

This test is a prototype for generated tests to verify parity across thrift files.
