   *     - Â±0.0, NaN (f64)

   *
   * This *mostly* matches "falsy" values in JavaScript for the subset of its
   * types that have an analog in Whisker:
   *   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy
   *
   * Empty arrays are not "falsy" in JavaScript, but they are in Whisker. This
   * is for conformance with the Mustache spec:
   *   https://github.com/mustache/spec/blob/v1.4.2/specs/inverted.yml#L67-L71
   *
   * Note that arrays and maps are also supported values in section blocks but
   * they perform iteration or unpacking respectively. Therefore, they are not
   * subject to this option. Inverted section-blocks, however, are considered
   * conditionals.
