{{!
    Why use a partial for a single line import rather than the import directly?

    The goal of partial was NOT to reduce the length of the identifier at the
    sites that reference it.
    1. The name of the partial reveals intent, similar to the use of functions.
    2. It is easier to document the intent and not pollute the call-sites
    with this detail.
